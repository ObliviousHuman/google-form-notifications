/**
 * This script is designed to send an email notification when a Google Form is submitted.
 * It retrieves the form responses, formats them into an HTML table, and sends an email to the specified recipients.
 * The script also includes a mode switch (TEST/PROD) to control the email subject and recipients.
 * The email includes a link to the form responses summary and the linked Google Sheet (if available).
 * The script is designed to be used as a library, so you can import it into your own Google Apps Script project.
 * Note: This script assumes that the form has a linked Google Sheet for responses.
 * If the form does not have a linked sheet, it will notify you in the email.
 * 
 * To use this script, you need to set up a trigger in Google Apps Script:
 * 1. Open your Google Form.
 * 2. Click on the three dots in the top right corner and select "Script editor".
 * 3. Copy and paste this script into the script editor.
 * 4. Save the script with a name like "Form Mailer Notifications".
 * 5. Set up a trigger by clicking on the clock icon in the toolbar.
 * 6. Choose "From form" as the event source and "On form submit" as the event type.
 * 7. Save the trigger.
 * 
 * This script will now run every time a form is submitted, sending an email notification with the submitted responses.
 * You can customize the email subject, recipients, and other settings by modifying the constants at the top of the script.
 * Note: This script is designed to be used as a library, so you can import it into your own Google Apps Script project.
 * To use this script as a library, you can follow these steps:
 * 1. Open your Google Apps Script project.
 * 2. Click on "Libraries" in the left sidebar.
 * 3. Click on "Add a library" and enter the script ID of this library.
 * 4. Click on "Add" to add the library to your project.
 * 5. Once the library is added, you can use the `onFormSubmit` function in your own form scripts.
 * Example usage:
 * ```javascript
 *    function runLibrary(e) {
 *      const formId = FormApp.getActiveForm().getId();
 *      FormMailerNotifications.onFormSubmit(e, formId);  // replace with your library
 *    }
 * ```
 * To run this script, you need to create a function that calls the `onFormSubmit` function with the event object `e` and the form ID.
